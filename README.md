# Controlled-Penetration-Testing-Lab: Exploiting Legacy System Vulnerabilities

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

Design and execute a controlled penetration testing lab focused on identifying and exploiting known vulnerabilities in legacy systems within an isolated environment. This project demonstrates the use of ethical hacking techniques to assess system weaknesses, validate exploitability, and document findings while maintaining strict scope control and responsible testing practices. The lab emphasizes understanding legacy system risks and translating technical vulnerabilities into actionable security insights.
